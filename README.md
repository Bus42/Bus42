## My Journey

<hr/>
I started learning to code in 2016 when I took a course from EdX called LFS 101 - Linux for Starters. I enjoyed coding and decided I'd learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent a year learning vanilla JS and CSS before moving on to jQuery and Bootstrap so I knew what was happening *under the hood*. It wasn't long before I started learning Git and GitHub.

Being a single father who worked 12 hour days, I didn't have a lot of time to devote to learning. However, I built several projects, some of which you can view on [my portfolio](https://portfolio.studio42dev.com), and earned the following certifications from freeCodeCamp during that time:

<img src="assets/certificate.svg" width="45px" > [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/front-end-development-libraries)

<img src="assets/certificate.svg" width="45px" > [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/responsive-web-design)

<img src="assets/certificate.svg" width="45px" > [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)

Since then, my kids have grown and I have focused on JavaScript development in React and Node in a Linux environment. I spent long enough learning on my own and am now a student at Bloom Institute of Technology studying computer science and full-stack development with a focus on React, Node, SQL, and Agile methodologies.

While completing my education, I am freelancing as [Studio42Dev](https://studio42dev.com). I build small websites, apps, and other projects for clients. My latest project is a serverless app that is built with React and ChakraUI and is deployed on Vercel.

## About Me

<hr/>

### Some of my favorite books:

<img src="assets/book.png" width="40px" > Dune

<img src="assets/book.png" width="40px" > Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

<img src="assets/book.png" width="40px" > War and Peace

I love ThunderCats, Star Wars, Robot Chicken, and documentaries.

I love cooking, and not cooking.

I love to sing.

I've only seen the first three Harry Potter movies, and I'm good with that.

I vehemently dislike auto-tune, reality TV, and that plastic film that my friends never take off of their electronics.

<img src="assets/SCBAwhat.jpeg" width="120px" style="border-radius: 8px" > I also volunteer on my local fire department. I am trained in CPR, Basic Life Support, and first aid as well as extrication and traffic incident management - and, as it turns out, I can still manage to look goofy in structural gear.

I'm a Linux fan but I like to play games too, and while you can play most titles on Linux, you can't play them all so I dual-boot on my PC. Also, I must like suffering because I dual-boot on my PC _and_ do my own mechanical work on my Volkswagen.

### My favorite Linux distros:

- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) (RHEL) with KDE Plasma Desktop - My daily driver. Beautiful, powerful, and easy to use. No wonder Linus uses it.
- [Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/) - Highly customizable and easy to use with some really nice quality of life features.
- [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/index.html) KDE Dr460nized (Arch) - The OS made for Linux Gamers.
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (Arch) Gnome - Highly polished and easy to use Arch distro.
- [PeppermintOS](https://peppermintos.com/) (Debian) - Super lightweight, yet powerful and fully featured. I run this on one of my decade+ old computers, of which I have a few - can't seem to get rid of them.
