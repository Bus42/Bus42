# Hi, I'm Greg and I like to make things.
I started learning to code in 2016 when I took a course from EdX called LFS 101 - Linux for Starters. I enjoyed coding and decided I'd learn `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. I spent a year learning vanilla JS and CSS before moving on to `jQuery` and `Bootstrap` so I knew what was happening *under the hood*. It wasn't long before I started learning `Git` and `GitHub`.

Being a single father who worked 12 hour days, I didn't have a lot of time to devote to learning, however, I earned the following certifications from freeCodeCamp during that time:

* [Front End (Legacy)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/legacy-front-end)

* [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/front-end-development-libraries)

* [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/responsive-web-design)

* [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)

I also built several projects, some of which you can view on [my portfolio](https://portfolio.studio42dev.com).

Since then, my kids have grown and I have focused on JavaScript development in React and Node in a `Linux` environment. I spent long enough learning on my own and am now a student at Bloom Institute of Technology studying computer science and full-stack development with a focus on `React`, `Node`, `SQL`, and `Agile` methodologies.

While I am completing my education, I am also freelancing as [Studio42Dev](https://studio42dev.com). I build small websites, apps, and other projects for clients. My latest project is a serverless app that is built with `React` and `ChakraUI` and is deployed on `Vercel`.
