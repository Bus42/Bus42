My Journey


I started learning to code in the summer of 2016 when I took a course from EdX called LFS 101 - Linux for Starters. I enjoyed coding and decided I'd learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent a year learning vanilla JS and CSS before moving on to jQuery and Bootstrap so I knew what was happening _under the hood_. It wasn't long before I started learning Git and GitHub.

Being a single father who worked 12 hour days, I didn't have a lot of time to devote to learning. However, I built several projects, some of which you can view on [my portfolio](https://portfolio.studio42dev.com), and earned the following certifications from freeCodeCamp during that time:

            >
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Since then, my kids have grown and I have focused on JavaScript development in React and Node in a Linux environment. I spent long enough learning on my own and am now a student at Bloom Institute of Technology studying computer science and full-stack development with a focus on React, Node, SQL, and Agile methodologies.

While completing my education, I am freelancing as [Studio42 Dev](https://studio42dev.com). I build small websites, apps, and other projects for clients. My latest project is a serverless app that is built with React and ChakraUI and is deployed on Vercel.

## About Me

                I live in a tiny little town of just over 150 people and volunteer
                on my local fire department. I am trained in CPR, Basic Life
                Support, and first aid as well as extrication and traffic incident
                management. As it turns out, I can still manage to look goofy in
                structural gear.
                </p>

              I'm a Linux fan but I like to play games too, and while you can
              play most titles on Linux, you can't play them all so I dual-boot
              on my PC. Also, I must like suffering because I dual-boot on my PC
              _and_ do my own mechanical work on my Volkswagen.

I love ThunderCats, Star Wars, Robot Chicken, and documentaries. I love cooking, and not cooking. I love to sing. I've only seen the first three Harry Potter movies, and I'm good with that. I vehemently dislike auto-tune, reality TV, and that plastic film that my friends never take off of their electronics.
