My Journey
----------

* * *

I started learning to code in the summer of 2016 when I took a course from EdX called LFS 101 - Linux for Starters. I enjoyed coding and decided I'd learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent a year learning vanilla JS and CSS before moving on to jQuery and Bootstrap so I knew what was happening _under the hood_. It wasn't long before I started learning Git and GitHub.

Being a single father who worked 12 hour days, I didn't have a lot of time to devote to learning. However, I built several projects, some of which you can view on [my portfolio](https://portfolio.studio42dev.com), and earned the following certifications from freeCodeCamp during that time:

[Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/front-end-development-libraries)

[Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/responsive-web-design)

[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bus42/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)

Since then, my kids have grown and I have focused on JavaScript development in React and Node in a Linux environment. I spent long enough learning on my own and am now a student at Bloom Institute of Technology studying computer science and full-stack development with a focus on React, Node, SQL, and Agile methodologies.

While completing my education, I am freelancing as [Studio42 Dev](https://studio42dev.com). I build small websites, apps, and other projects for clients. My latest project is a serverless app that is built with React and ChakraUI and is deployed on Vercel.

About Me
--------

![](assets/SCBAwhat.jpeg)

I live in a tiny little town of just over 150 people and volunteer on my local fire department. I am trained in CPR, Basic Life Support, and first aid as well as extrication and traffic incident management. As it turns out, I can still manage to look goofy in structural gear.

I'm a Linux fan but I like to play games too, and while you can play most titles on Linux, you can't play them all so I dual-boot on my PC. Also, I must like suffering because I dual-boot on my PC \_and\_ do my own mechanical work on my Volkswagen.

### Some of my favorite books

Dune

Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy

![book icon](assets/book.png)

War and Peace

I love ThunderCats, Star Wars, Robot Chicken, and documentaries. I love cooking, and not cooking. I love to sing. I've only seen the first three Harry Potter movies, and I'm good with that. I vehemently dislike auto-tune, reality TV, and that plastic film that my friends never take off of their electronics.

### My favorite Linux distros

![Fedora Linux Logo](assets/SeekPng.com_fedora-png_2071630.png)

[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) (RHEL) with KDE Plasma Desktop - My daily driver. Beautiful, powerful, and easy to use. No wonder Linus uses it.

![Ubuntu Budgie Logo](assets/Ubuntu_Budgie_No_Wordmark.svg)

[Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org) Highly customizable and easy to use with some really nice quality of life features.

![Garuda Linux Logo](/assets/Garuda-blue-sgs.svg)

[Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/index.html) KDE Dr460nized (Arch) - The OS made for Linux Gamers

![Manjaro Linux logo](/assets/Manjaro-logo.svg)

[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (Arch) Gnome - Highly polished and easy to use Arch distro.

![Peppermint OS logo](/assets/peppermint_os.png)

[PeppermintOS](https://peppermintos.com/) (Debian) - Super lightweight, yet powerful and fully featured. I run this on one of my decade+ old computers, of which I have a few - can't seem to get rid of them.
